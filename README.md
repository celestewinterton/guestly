[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Seating Charts 
  * This feature is currently in development and will allow a planner to create tables and assign a max capacity. 
  * Upon registering for an event, users would have the ability to select their seating preference.

### Invitations
  * Planners would send invites via email to their guestlist and show as pending until the guest has confirmed.

### Gift Registry 
  * The event details would include a new tab with a gift registry
  * Planner would be able to create, edit and delete items on the registry and guests would have read access

### Drag and Drop Visual Seating Configuration
  * To make the seating charts more intuitive, a drag-and-drop feature for tables would be enable Planners to shwo a more accurate representation of the space and provide more visibility to guests when selecting seating.
